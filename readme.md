# Developer Charts

The Helm charts in this collection support [Golden Path Templates](https://github.com/contract-first-idp/software-templates). The collection of charts is considered part of the Internal Developer Platform, and is intended to support quick onboarding of new application components by providing standard, vetted, and approved configuration.

This repository is maintained by the Developer Platform team, but contributions are welcome from developer teams who are current or prospective users of the platform.
